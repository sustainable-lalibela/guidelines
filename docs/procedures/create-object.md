Tutorial. Creating ArcheoGRID object
===

The deposit of the file has been made on ArcheoGRID.

I need:

1. to create the objet (required)
- to describe the object (required)
- to illustrate the object (optional)
- to link all the related resources (optional)


!!! note

    Sustainable Lalibela Project
    
    - Group 3. Mikiyas (speaker), Fiseha, Zelalem, Mengistie
	e
	**DRAFT. To be completed with screenshots.**



## 1. Create the objet

- Open ArcheoGRID
- Open the `Lalibela Eglises rupestres` project
- Go to the folder `LALIBELA_eglises_rupestres/{object-type}`, e.g. `LALIBELA_eglises_rupestres/Manuscripts/` if you want to create a manuscript.
- Right click > `Create object in this folder "folder_name"`
- Name the object  
**The name of the object MUST be the name of the manuscript**. For instance, for the manuscript which has the call number `SL_MS_StLalibela_LCM_035`, the name of the object will be `SL_MS_StLalibela_LCM_035`.
- Congratulation! The object has been created.


!!! info

	**For resources** (e.g. images of a manuscript) the Project folder tree must be like:
	
	```
	LALIBELA_eglises_rupestres/ 
		Resources/
			Manuscripts/
				SL_MS_StLalibela_LCM_035/
					SL_MS_StLalibela_LCM_035_0001.tif
					SL_MS_StLalibela_LCM_035_0002.tif
					SL_MS_StLalibela_LCM_035_0003.tif
					…
				SL_MS_StLalibela_BGA_002/
					SL_MS_StLalibela_BGA_002_0001.jpg
					SL_MS_StLalibela_BGA_002_0002.jpg
					SL_MS_StLalibela_BGA_002_0003.jpg
					…
			Manbara_Tabots/
			Crosses/
			…
	```
	
	**For objects** (e.g. a manuscript) the Project folder tree must be like:
	
	```
	LALIBELA_eglises_rupestres/ 
		Crosses/
		Icons/
		Manbara_Tabots/
		Manuscripts/
			SL_MS_StLalibela_LCM_035
			SL_MS_StLalibela_BGA_002
			…
	```


## 2. Describe the object (required)

1. Go to the object
- Click on the icon on the upper right part of the object card
- Click on the `Add metadata` button
- Select in the drop down menu the right model (eg. `Manuscript` for manuscripts)
- Fill all the metadata form, **following the Guidelines**.
- Click on the `Save` button.

!!! tip

	If the “save” button doesn't work, it's probably because one of the values entered is not compliant with the model.


## 3. Illustrate your object (optional)

I want to illustrate my object with one of its image.


1. Go to `My selection`, and click on the `Delete selection` button.
- Go to the folder containing the images of the object.
- Select **only** one image by clicking on the upper part of the image preview – it should be highlighted in blue.
- Save selection
- Go to `Show the Selection` and select the name of the object in the list and click on the `Illustrate` button.



## 4. Link (all) the resources (optional)

I want to link all resources to their object (e.g. link all images of a manuscript to its record).

1. Go to `My selection`, and click on the `Delete selection` button.
- Select all the resources related to the object, e.g. all the images of a manuscript
- Go to `My selection` and click oon the `Save selection` button.
- Go to Show the Selection and select the name of object in the list and click on the `Link` button.

Done!
