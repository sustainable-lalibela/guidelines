Tutorial. Preparing ArcheoGRID deposit folder
===

I have made pictures with my Nikon camera and I'm back in the Lalibela Church Museum to prepare the deposit folder.

I need:

1. to transfer the pictures on the computer
2. to prepare the ArcheoGRID deposit folder


!!! note "Group 1 report"

    Sustainable Lalibela Project
    
    - Desale (speaker), Tegegne, Alemu T., Abebe

    **DRAFT. To be completed with screenshots.**



## 1. Transfering files


**2 Steps**

**1\. I open my personal folder inside the `Documents/` folder on the computer I use.**

- I click on the folder icon in the task bar (bottom of the screen).
- I open my personnal folder, e.g. `Documents/Fiseha`.

**2\. I transfer the images from the memory card of the camera**

- Using a *good working* adaptor, I plug the memory card in the computer USB slot.
- I open the directory with the Explorer.
- **I select the relevant images**.
- I copy/paste those selected images in my personal folder in a dedicated folder.

I can organize my personal folder as I want. For instance I can create a folder for each type of object.


!!! example "Example of organization of data in the personal directory"
	
	```
	Documents/
	fiseha/
		manuscripts/
			one_folder_per_manuscript/
		icons/
			one_folder_per_icon/
	mikiyas/
		gospels/
		mydocs/
	```


## 2. Preparing the archeoGRID deposit

**2 Steps**

**1\. Rename manually the object folder**

The folder I created in my personal directory –containing all the images –MUST be manually renamed using the call number of the object.

For instance, the folder containing the images of a manuscript MUST be named after the manuscript call number.


!!! warning
	
	I MUST always refer to that documentation to rename the folder (follow the naming rules).


Then, I have something like:

```
Documents/
	fiseha/
		manuscripts/
			SL_MS_StLalibela_BGO_018/
				_DSC2316.JPG
				_DSC2317.JPG
				_DSC2318.JPG
				_DSC2319.JPG
				…
```

Last, I have to rename the images.


**2\. Rename automatically the files using Bulk Rename Utility**

**TODO: tutorial video**


!!! tip
	
	In Bulk Rename Utility, **use the parent folder prefix option**.


Finaly, I must have something like:

```
Documents/
	fiseha/
		manuscripts/
			SL_MS_StLalibela_BGO_018/
				SL_MS_StLalibela_BGO_018_0001.JPG
				SL_MS_StLalibela_BGO_018_0002.JPG
				SL_MS_StLalibela_BGO_018_0003.JPG
				SL_MS_StLalibela_BGO_018_0004.JPG
				…
```
